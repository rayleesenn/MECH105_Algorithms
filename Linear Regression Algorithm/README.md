# WHAT DOES THE LINEAR REGRESSION ALGORITHM DO?
## *This algorithm is used to find the outliers of a data set, compute a linear regression, and find the coefficient of determination.*

### Inputs:
* x = x-values of the data set
* y = y-values of the data set

### Outputs:
* fX = filtered x-values sorted from smallest to largest
* fY = filtered y-values sorted from smallest to largest
* slope = slope from the linear regression
* intercept = intercept from the linear regression 
* Rsquared = R^2, aka the coefficient of determination

### Limitations:
* Sizes of x and y must be the same.
* Outliers must be filtered out.
* x and y must be sorted from smallest to largest.
