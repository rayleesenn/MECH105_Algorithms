# WHAT DOES THE SPECIAL MATRIX ALGORITHM DO?
## *This is an algorithm that creates a function to return an nxm matrix.*

### Inputs:
* n = number of rows
* m = number of columns

### Outputs:
* A = matrix A

### Limitations:
* The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.
* The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.
* The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.
* The function must return a sensible error if the user does not input exactly two arguments.
