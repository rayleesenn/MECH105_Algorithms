# WHAT DOES SIMPSON'S 1/3 RULE DO?
## *This algorithm is used to integrate experimental data using Simpson's 1/3 Rule.*

### Inputs:
* x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y = the vector of function values with respect to x

### Outputs:
* I = the numerical integral calculated

### Limitations:
* Inputs must the same length.
* The x input must be equally spaced.
* Trapezoidal rule has to be used on the last interval if there are an odd number of intervals.
