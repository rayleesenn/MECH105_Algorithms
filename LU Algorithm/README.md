# WHAT DOES THE LU FACTORIZATION ALGORITHM DO?
## *This algorithm is used to develop a function that determines the LU factorization of a square matrix.*

### Inputs:
* A = coefficient matrix

### Outputs:
* L = lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = the pivot matrix

### Limitations:
* Matrix must be square
* PxA must equal LxU
* Matrices L and U must be triangular
